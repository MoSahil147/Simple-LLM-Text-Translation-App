# Simple-LLM-Text-Translation-App
This project demonstrates how to build a simple LLM-powered translation app using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). The app takes English text and translates it into another language using a single LLM call with prompt chaining.

We learnt how to:
	•	Use language models (Groq + Gemma2-9b-It)
	•	Create PromptTemplates and OutputParsers
	•	Chain components using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
	•	Serve your chain with FastAPI + LangServe
	•	Build a frontend using Streamlit
